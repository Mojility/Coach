# Cucumber Fizzbuzz Example for JS

This example uses cucumber-js to illustrate using gherkin
to build specifications that can exercise your Javascript
code.

Check out the repository and then run the following commands
to execute the tests.

```js
npm install
npm test
```

This is a minimal skeleton project, provided for illustration
purposes only.

Remember, when choosing a framework for running your automated
tests, you have many factors to consider.

As a developer, if non-developers are participating in the
definition of or refining of the specifications for the
code you're writing, you can use cucumber to provide a friendly way to
prompt discussion with them, without exposing them to
code.
